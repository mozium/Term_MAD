The term project was to replicate the game of [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) that can be played by two individuals in an iOS application. My main responsibility was to develop appropriate algorithms to calculate the target stones of each move, and determine the appropriate moment for it to take effect. The algorithm can be modified to create a simple AI player in the future.
